# Welcome to the Multimodel RAG Chatbot

This is a sample document to demonstrate the capabilities of the RAG chatbot system.

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge sources. This chatbot implementation supports multiple AI models and can process various document types.

## Key Features

### Document Processing
- Support for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and Markdown files
- Intelligent text chunking for optimal retrieval
- Metadata preservation for source attribution

### AI Model Support
The system supports multiple AI providers:
- OpenAI GPT models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4)
- Anthropic Claude models (Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet)

### Vector Search
- Uses ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
- Sentence transformer embeddings for semantic understanding
- Configurable retrieval parameters

## How to Use

1. Load your documents into the system
2. Select your preferred AI model
3. Ask questions about your documents
4. Get contextually aware responses with source attribution

## Technical Details

The system uses a modular architecture with separate components for:
- Document processing and chunking
- Vector storage and retrieval
- Model management and response generation
- User interfaces (CLI and web)

This allows for easy extension and customization based on specific needs.

## Sample Questions

Try asking questions like:
- "What are the key features of this system?"
- "How does the document processing work?"
- "What AI models are supported?"
- "Explain the RAG architecture"

The chatbot will use this document and any others you've loaded to provide informed responses.
